# FT_DPRINTF

The dprintf function in C allows formatted data to be written to a specified file descriptor. It is an extension of the standard printf function, enabling developers to dynamically generate and output formatted content to diverse destinations such as files, sockets, or custom output streams identified by their descriptors. This function is particularly useful when precise control over the destination of formatted output is required, providing a versatile tool for efficient I/O operations in C programs.
